# Milestone 6
## Get the robot to solve the maze with branching and repeat to follow a memorized path

Milestone 6 was accomplished on May 7th! <br/>
Milestone 6 was very difficult to accomplish: the robot missed many left turns (the goal of Milestone 5!) because the tape lifted and had to be smoothed out (perhaps this was because the tape lost its stickiness as I kept reusing it...moral: don't be overly cautious). Finally though, by ensuring that the tape was smoothed out before every trial, Milestone 6 was completed! <br/>
