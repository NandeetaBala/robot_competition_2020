# Milestone 6
## Get the robot to solve the maze with branching and repeat to follow a memorized path

Milestone 6 was accomplished on May 7th! <br/>
Milestone 6 was very difficult to accomplish: the robot missed many left turns (the goal of Milestone 5!) because the tape lifted and had to be smoothed out (perhaps this was because the tape lost its stickiness as I kept reusing it...). When Milestone 5 was accomplished in the first part of the video, Milestone 6 would not be because of similar issues. Finally though, Milestone 6 was completed! <br/>
