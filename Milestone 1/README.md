# Milestone 1
## Get the robot to move

Milestone 1 was accomplished on May 6th! 
First, I forgot to include the RightSpeed to the code and found the robot spin.

However, when I added the RightMotor, it worked fine! 

Then, Nick and David began to assemble the pieces while Nandeeta and Mike assembled the chassis. Mike and Nandeeta drew a rough draft on foamcore and then Mike used a program to scale the draft (below: 8in x 8in ). Nandeeta took all of these amazing photos. <br/>
