# Milestone 5
## Get the robot to navigate a maze with branching

Milestone 5 was also accomplished on May 7th! <br/>
The appropriate maze layout was created; however, some of the measurements were ½ in or so off. By integrating the suggested code into Milestone 4’s code, Milestone 5 was also accomplished. <br/>
