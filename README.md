# Robot Competition 2020!
### Notes on the remote robot competition
Notebook entries are included within each folder! The best run code is milestone_7_code_2 with a run time of 10 s. Thank you for organizing this project in such a short amount of time! I missed the initial project but had fun and learned a lot from this one. <br/>
**Note**: please ignore the .DS store files. I do not know what they are and they made it difficult for me to access Github online and on my desktop so I just let it be there when it did not interfere. <br/>
